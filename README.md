Daily Kata sessions codes and notes. Sessions organized by Tim Bathan (https://github.com/bathant702), a member of my General Assembly Cohort from Spring 2023.

- Daily coding/Kata exercises for approximately 30-60 minutes. We code solo then we present how far we've and discuss our approaches with each other, what resources we used outside our existing knowledge (if any), and just open it up to talk about the exercise itself and how we tackled it. -

- This allows for practicing "making bigger proglems into smaller problems" within a group/collaborative environment that has a flow, while mixing up the challenges daily to keep us on our toes with our JavaScript.
